<h1>In silico demonstration of in vitro scratch wound healing using PhysiCell.</h1>

<h3>Objective:</h3>

<p>Develop an in silico model that simulates in vitro scratch wound healing cell behavior. We have only one active cell type, the epithelial cells.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Detect local pressure</li>
	<li>Divide and migrate in low-pressure conditions</li>
	<li>Regain static behavior when pressure increases enough</li>
	<li>Detect velocities of neighboring cells</li>
	<li>Update bias direction based on boids&#39; rule</li>
</ul>

<p>We also have wall &quot;cells&quot;. Static, non-moving, non-proliferating objects that are there to confine the epithelial cells.</p>

<p>For this tool the cells don&#39;t need to breathe or eat, they don&#39;t die either. We are also not using any kind of chemical signaling/communication. Therefore we disabled the diffusion solver to speed up the simulation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Boids&#39; movement decision making:</h3>

<p>Cell colective motion is achieved with a modified boid&#39;s rule,</p>

<p><strong>d </strong>(t)= &alpha; <strong><sup>v </sup></strong><sup>(t)</sup>&frasl;<sub>|<strong>v</strong> (t)|</sub> +&nbsp; &beta;&nbsp; <strong><sup>v<sub>n</sub></sup></strong><sup>(t)</sup>&frasl;<strong><sub>|v<sub>n</sub>|</sub></strong> + &gamma; <strong>b</strong> (t - &Delta;t)</p>

<p><strong>b</strong> (t) = <strong><sup>d </sup></strong><sup>(t)</sup>&frasl;<sub>|<strong>d</strong> (t)|</sub></p>

<p>Where &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma; are parameters,&nbsp;<strong>v</strong> is the cell&#39;s velocity,&nbsp;<strong>v</strong><sub>n</sub> is the sum of the neighbors&#39; velocity and <strong>b</strong> the bias direction. We define neighbors as all other cells that are in the mechanics&#39; interaction radius of the cell. The self-velocity term can be visualized as a momentum term, the previous bias as a memory of the internal organization of the cell.</p>
